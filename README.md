# Ghidra TopSM

This repository contains the sources of a Ghidra plugin that enables reverse engineering of TopSM binaries.

TopSM architecture is used in Texas Instruments CC13XX and CC26XX RF Cores.

This is a fork into a separate repo of the original Ghidra TopSM architecture plugin that can be found at <https://github.com/rjp5th/beyond-ble-tools/tree/main/ghidra_topsm>. This was originally released as part of the [Beyond BLE](https://events.ccc.de/congress/2024/hub/en/event/beyond-ble-cracking-open-the-black-box-of-rf-microcontrollers/) 38C3 talk.
